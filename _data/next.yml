  title: "Analyzing Video Game Player Experiences through Rhythmanalysis"
  abstract: "In this presentation, I will introduce a method for conducting 'rhythmanalysis' of gaming sessions, involving the collection and visualization of player inputs. This approach leads to intriguing questions about the aesthetics of video games, the interplay between the images and the hand, and the relationships between the video game experience and performing arts, such as music and dance."
