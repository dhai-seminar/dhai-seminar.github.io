  title: "Richelieu. Histoire du quartier, a digital ecosystem for the analysis of the urban experience through historical sources"
  abstract: "Newspaper illustrations, printed ads, restaurant menus, postcards, but also architectural blueprints and cadastral maps : throughout the 19th century, the urban setting was the ground for numerous representations, comments and documentation, in a context of unprecedented media production. We chose a multifaceted approach to these historical documents. A GIS documents maps evolutions in the plot plan ; OCRised registers offer a glimpse into the neighbourhood’s economic networks ; a 3D model allows us to spatialise representations of the place de la Bourse ; finally, an image-based corpus documents the urban imaginary throughout the XIXth century. By linking these heterogeneous data sources, first through an SQL database, then by developing a Web platform and custom data analysis tools, we aim to gain an understanding of the neighbourhood’s multiple layers : social, historical, economical and cultural."
