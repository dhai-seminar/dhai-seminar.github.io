  title: "Early conflict photography as data: an overview of the EyCon project"
  abstract: "The presentation will provide an overview of a project that aims at aggregating a thematic collection focusing on early conflict photography (1890-1918). The EyCon research project is experimenting with AI techniques to augment historical enquiry and data enrichment of a large visual corpus of historical photographs. It will add automatically enriched metadata to its online database and publish a prototype for the inclusion of AI functionalities into similar repositories. The team also reflects on the ethics of showing and facilitating access to a potentially contested material. The presentation will discuss the project's perimeter, its data architecture and provide case studies of how AI can be applied to late 19th c./early 20th c. photographs."
