  bio: "Alexei A. Efros is a professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at UC Berkeley.  Prior to that, he was on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University, and has also been a visiting scientist at École Normale Supérieure/INRIA and University of Oxford. His research is in the area of computer vision and computer graphics, especially at the intersection of the two. He is particularly interested in using data-driven techniques to tackle problems where large quantities of unlabeled visual data are readily available. Efros received his PhD in 2003 from UC Berkeley. He is a recipient of CVPR Best Paper Award (2006), NSF CAREER award (2006), Sloan Fellowship (2008), Guggenheim Fellowship (2008), SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award (2010), 3 Helmholtz Test-of-Time Prizes (1999,2003,2005), the ACM Prize in Computing (2016), and Diane McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching Computer Science (2019)."

  title: "Finding Visual Patterns in Large Photo Collections for Visualization, Analytics, and Artistic Expression"
  abstract: "Our world is drowning in a data deluge, and much of this data is visual.   Humanity has captured over one trillion photographs last year alone.  500 hours of video is being uploaded to YouTube every minute.   In fact, there is so much visual data out there already that much of it might never be seen by a human being! But unlike other types of “Big Data”, such as text, much of the visual content cannot be easily indexed or searched, making it Internet’s “digital dark matter” [Perona 2010].  In this talk, I will first discuss some of the unique challenges that make visual data difficult compared to other types of content.   I will them present some of our work on navigating, visualizing, and mining for visual patterns in large-scale image collections.  Example data sources will include user-contributed Flickr photographs, Google StreetView imagery of entire cities, a hundred years of high school student portraits, and  a collection of paintings attributed to Jan Brueghel.    I will also show how recent progress in using deep learning as a way to find visual patterns and correlations could be used to synthesize novel visual content using "image-to-image translation" paradigm.  I will conclude with examples of contemporary artists using our work as a new tool for artistic visual expression."

  title: "The Ontology of Sight in the Age of AI: The Machine Learned Image in Art, Architecture, and Historic Preservation"
  abstract: "This presentation investigates applications of machine learning for knowledge production and the ethical consequences of the creation of new visual systems to systematize information. Unlike applications of the term vision, which conjure vastly different meanings in the arts and the sciences, this paper underscores the use of the term sight to emphasize the contingency of a mode of interpretation in the act of seeing. In this regard the perceptual apparati of humans and machines to behold and interpret an image, and the philosophical implications of these processes as they are understood to function according to different models of seeing, whether they be experiential, simulated, theoretical, or even spiritual are differentiated. This presentation thus brings renewed attention to aesthetic theory and calls for a new philosophical paradigm of visual perception to be employed for the analysis and management of our visual culture and heritage in the age of AI, one which incorporates and actively partakes in the development of computer vision-based technologies."
