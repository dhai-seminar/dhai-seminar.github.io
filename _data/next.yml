  title: "Embedded Stories and Narrative Levels: a challenge for Computational Narrative"
  abstract: "Stories told by a character within a story are known as embedded stories.
They occur frequently in narrative and they constitute an important
challenge to models of narrative interpretation. Computational
procedures for interpreting a story need to account for these embedded
stories in terms of how to represent them and how to process them in
the context of the story acting as frame for them. The talk will explain
the concept of embedded stories over some real examples of narrative, describe
the challenges that their computational treatment poses, and
describe a simplified computational model for the task.
The proposed model is capable of representing discourses
for embedded stories and interpret them onto a representation
that captures their recursive structure. Some examples of application
of the model to examples of stories from different domains will be presented,
and some preliminary conclusions will be outlined on what embedding implies
in terms of computational interpretation of narrative, and the challenges it
poses for the ever-growing research efforts for the automated processing of narrative."
