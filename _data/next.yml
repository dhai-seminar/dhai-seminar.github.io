<b>Pedro Ortiz Suarez :</b> <i>Annotating Multilingual Heterogeneous Web-Based Corpora</i><br/>
In this talk we will introduce the OSCAR project and present our recent efforts in overcoming the difficulties posed by the heterogeneity, noisiness and size of web resources; in order to produce higher quality textual data for as many languages as possible. We will also discuss recent developments in the project, including our data-processing pipelines to annotate and classify large amounts of textual data in constrained environments. Finally, we will present how the OSCAR initiative is currently collaborating with other projects in order to improve data quality and availability for low-resource languages.<br/>
<b>Pedro Ortiz Suarez</b> is a Senior Research Scientist at the Common Crawl Foundation. He holds a PhD in computer science and Natural Language Processing from Sorbonne Université. Pedro’s research has mainly focused on how data quality impacts ML models’ performance and how to improve these models through data-driven approaches. Pedro has been a main contributor to multiple open source Large Language Model initiatives such as CamemBERT, BLOOM and OpenGPT-X. Prior to joining the Common Crawl Foundation, Pedro was the founder of the open source project OSCAR, that provides high performance data pipelines to annotate Common Crawl’s data and make it more accessible to NLP and LLM researchers and practitioners. Pedro has also participated to many projects in information extraction and other NLP applications for both the scientific domain and Digital Humanities.<br/>
<b>Philipp Schneider :</b> <i>The Digital Heraldry Projekt. A Knowledge Graph with Semantic Web Technologies and Machine Learning to study medieval visual sources</i><br/>
Visual communication forms an important part of medieval and early modern european culture. Especially coats of arms were widely used in different social groups and offer an important source for cultural history. This subject is at the center of the Digital Heraldry Project. Here, we created a Knowledge Graph with Semantic Web Technologies to (1) describe coats of arms, (2) trace their use over different types of historical sources and objects and link them to their images, (3) place these objects in their historical context of use, and (4) trace how and by whom coats of arms were used on these objects. Furthermore, the ontologies created for this Knowledge Graph are able to account for multiperspectivity regarding the description and interpretation of the historical sources it represents. The talk will give an overview on the project and its results with regard to the field of Digital History. Although mainly focusing on the parts of the project, dealing with symbolic AI, the presentation will also touch upon the integration of large image corpora into the Knowledge Graph through Machine Learning.<br/>
<b>Philipp Schneider</b> is a research assistant and PhD student in the Digital Heraldry Project, at the Chair for Digital History at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. His research focuses on ontology engineering and the application of Knowledge Graphs in historical studies — especially with regard to visual communication in the Middle Ages. Philipp studied history and computer science."
