  title: "Algorithms in the Abbey: Deep Learning and Medieval Music"
  abstract: "In this presentation, we will explore the impact of deep learning techniques on research at the intersection of musicology and medieval studies. We will commence by analysing the utilization of deep learning for Optical Music Recognition (OMR) within the realms of medieval musicology and computer science. Subsequently, we will investigate its applications in the analysis of medieval images, particularly in the context of musical iconography and organology. Finally, we will delve into the application of these techniques in examining the relationship between text and medieval music, with a specific focus on stylometry applied to medieval secular songs.
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Xavier Fresquet serves as the Deputy Director at the Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence (SCAI). Following the completion of his Ph.D. in musicology and digital humanities at Paris-Sorbonne, Xavier Fresquet joined UPMC, later becoming a part of Sorbonne University, in 2015. His research interests revolve around the intersections of musicology, medieval studies, and digital humanities, with a recent focus on machine learning. It encompasses the analysis of images depicting medieval performances, use of theoretical texts related to the Medieval musical world, and the study of musical notation. Xavier Fresquet actively participates in the <a href='https://musiconis.huma-num.fr/fr/'>Musiconis</a> database, the most extensive repository of medieval musical iconography. Additionally, he authors a musicological blog named <a href='https://mnemomed.hypotheses.org'>Mnemomed</a>, devoted to the exploration of the Mediterranean's medieval musical heritage.</p>"
